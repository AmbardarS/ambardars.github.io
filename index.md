I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with research interests in Applied Microeconomics and Economic History. Much of my work involves turning messy or hidden archival records into usable data - making invisible information visible - through OCR, AI tools, and digitization. I use these newly built datasets to study how institutions and technological change shape markets, with a focus on how firms and workers respond to technological, institutional, and policy shocks. Before graduate school, I earned a B.A. in Economics and Mathematics from [Beloit College](https://www.beloit.edu/).
